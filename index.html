              <p>You're right - we <i>were</i> going to get married in September. But, extenuating circumstances have coerced us to move the date up. </p>

              <p>That means there's no reception and that our ceremony and dinner have limited capacity. In fact, dinner has no capacity - it's just going to be a small, intimate group of family members.</p>

              <p>However, we're going out on the town after our dinner to celebrate. 
                <br><b>This is an open invite</b> (yes, you're invited and yes, we want you to come). 
                </p>

                Here's the fun part: after our toast at Howe's Bayou at 10PM, we're going to go bar hopping around Ferndale to celebrate our nuptials. Want to join? Please do - the more, the merrier. </p>

                Coming from out of town and need a hotel?

                <p>
                  If you've been drinking and need to get back to that hotel, there are always tons of cabs in Ferndale from 1-2:30am & there are <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a> drivers in the area.

              <p>
                If you're coming out for just the toast and after-party, you're in luck: parking enforcement ends at 9pm. Otherwise, there are several paid lots in the area.
              </p>

              <p>Even better: parking is <i>free</i> on Sundays. That means you can come back in the morning to retrieve your car, if you had to leave it behind. </p>

              <p>Please, do not find out the hard way that parking in Ferndale neighborhoods usually gets you a parking ticket. Pay a few dollars ($0.50/hour) and park in a lot. <span class="small"> If you're too cheap for that, there is a free parking lot at the American Legion (corner of 9Mile and Livernois)</span>.</p>

              <p>
                The majority of our friends - whether it be insanity, stupidity, or thrill-seeking - have a terrible track record at drunk driving. If you're coming to celebrate our wedding, please <i>don't drive home drunk</i>. You're not only putting yourself/others in danger, but you're sh*tting on our wishes. <b>If we find out you drove home drunk, we swear we'll never talk to you again</b>.</p>
              <p>
                There is a 99% chance we're going to hire a big van to take us home. Please, get on the van with us and let us pay to drive your drunk ass home.</p>
